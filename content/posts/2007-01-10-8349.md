Интереснейший <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/01/09/iphone-and-the-end-of-pc-era/" target="_blank">комментарий к сегодняшней презентации Джобса от Ом Малика</a>:

> The real story of the day came at the very end of his keynote.
> 
> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“From this day forward we’re going to be known as Apple, Inc. We’ve dropped the computer from our name.” And then he quoted ice skating legend Wayne Gretzky. “‘I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it’s been.’ That’s what we try to do at Apple.”</span>
> 
> That also might be the epitaph of the PC era. And it is sweet irony that the company that sparked off the desktop computing revolution is the one announcing its passing.  
> Dropping Computer from its name is a sure sign that Apple, from this point forward, is a consumer electronics company, a mobile handset maker &#8212; one that also makes computer hardware and software as well.
