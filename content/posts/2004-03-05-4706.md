<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/05/politics/05MISS.html" target="_blank">Центральная статья</a> в сегодняшней New York Times:

> WASHINGTON, March 4 &#8212; A group of Russian engineers secretly aided Saddam Hussein&#8217;s long-range ballistic missile program, providing technical assistance for prohibited Iraqi weapons projects even in the years just before the war that ousted him from power, American government officials say.
> 
> Iraqis who were involved in the missile work told American investigators that the technicians had not been working for the Russian government, but for a private company. But any such work on Iraq&#8217;s banned missiles would have violated United Nations sanctions, even as the Security Council sought to enforce them.
