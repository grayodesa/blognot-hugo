Метеорологи <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/09/04/D8CD7N400.html" target="_blank">предупреждают</a> &#8212; &#171;Катрина&#187; отнюдь не последний ураган этого сезона:

> Katrina may seem like the last word in hurricanes, but there is a very real possibility that another major hurricane may hit New Orleans or some other portion of the 200-mile coastline devastated by Katrina in the weeks to come.
> 
> &#171;We&#8217;re not out of the woods yet,&#187; said Susan Cutter, director of the University of South Carolina Hazards Research Laboratory. &#171;We&#8217;re not even in the height of hurricane season.&#187;
> 
> A forecast released Friday by meteorologists at Colorado State University calls for six more hurricanes by the time the hurricane season ends on Nov. 30, three of them Category 3 or above. On average, about one major hurricane in three makes landfall in the United States.
> 
> &#171;We expect that by the time the 2005 hurricane season is over, we will witness tropical cyclone activity at near record levels,&#187; the Colorado State meteorologists wrote.
