Интересная заметка про то, что <a href="http://priceonomics.com/why-ups-trucks-dont-turn-left/" target="_blank">грузовики службы доставки UPS всегда ездят так, чтобы делать только правые повороты</a>.

> When better tracking systems emerged in 2001, the package delivery service took a closer look at how trucks performed when delivering packages. As a logistics company with some 96,000 trucks and several hundred aircraft, much of UPS&#8217;s business can be distilled to a series of optimization problems around reducing the amount of fuel used, saving time, and using space more efficiently. (Trucks in UPS facilities park just a few inches apart with their[side mirrors overlapping][1] to save space.)
> 
> UPS engineers found that left-hand turns were a major drag on efficiency. Turning against traffic resulted in long waits in left-hand turn lanes that wasted time and fuel, and it also led to a disproportionate number of accidents. By mapping out routes that involved [&#171;a series of right-hand loops,&#187;][2] UPS improved profits and safety while touting their catchy, environmentally friendly policy. As of 2012, the right turn rule combined with other improvements &#8212; for the wow factor, UPS doesn&#8217;t separate them out &#8212; [saved][2] around 10 million gallons of gas and reduced emissions by the equivalent of taking 5,300 cars of the road for a year.
> 
> Describing the policy in a speech, the CEO of UPS [told his audience][3], &#171;I can see a few of you smiling out there, and I know what you may be thinking. But it really works.&#187;

Получается, что популярный подход женщины-новичка за рулем — спланировать маршрут так, чтобы никогда не поворачивать налево на нерегулируемом перекрестке, — не такой уж и глупый.
