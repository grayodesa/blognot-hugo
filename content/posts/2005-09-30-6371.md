P2P-сети прекратят свое существование в течение ближайших нескольких месяцев, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/09/30/HNptopdisappear_1.html" target="_blank">заявил</a> президент компании Metamachine, разработчика eDonkey:

> Peer-to-peer (P-to-P) file-sharing companies in the U.S. will cease to exist in their current forms over the next few months, the president of MetaMachine, the company responsible for the eDonkey software, predicts.
> 
> Speaking at a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Sam Yagan said that in order to avoid expensive litigation, file-sharing companies will have to change their models to become similar to iTunes or the new Napster or face expensive legal battles.
> 
> MetaMachine won&#8217;t be an exception. &#171;Because we cannot afford to fight a lawsuit &#8212; even one we think we would win &#8212; we have instead prepared to convert eDonkey&#8217;s user base to an online content retailer operating in a &#8216;closed&#8217; P-to-P environment,&#187; he said.
