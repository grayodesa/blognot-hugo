Бывший мэр Нью-Йорка Руди Джулиани [назвал][1] Барака Обаму неспособным на какие-либо решения:

> He mocked Obama’s background as a community organizer, saying it is the wrong kind of experience for a president, adding, “It’s worse than we thought, isn’t it? He really seems like he doesn’t know what he’s doing. “
> 
> He accused the president of “dithering” over Libya, and called him “incapable of making a decision.”
> 
> “This president has been a failure in just about every single thing that he’s done,” he said.
> 
> “The president of the United States gave [the anti-Qadhafi forces] encouragement. &#8230; [And people] got killed and slaughtered by Qadhafi while Obama dithered,” he thundered. “That’s a president? That’s what we want in this country? Can we stand two more years of this? Well, we’re going to have to.”

Правда, он говорил это все на пресс-конференции в пятницу, а с тех пор Обама все же принял решение. Если это он принял :).
