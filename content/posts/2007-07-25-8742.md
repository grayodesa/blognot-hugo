Дэйв Винер <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/07/25/iphoneMonth1.html" target="_blank">сравнивает</a> iPhone с BlackBerry по итогам первого месяца использования &#8212; и тоже делает вывод в пользу BlackBerry. Хотя и оставляет шансы:

> how different the situation would be if the iPhone had a full SDK, if you could run Mac OS apps on the device, or if it had a built-in HTTP server that would allow you to browse or configure it over wifi from a Mac or Windows machine. In other words, if it had the kind of revolutionary features and was an open platform in the tradition of Apple and the PC industry.
> 
> No doubt we&#8217;d be trying a dozen different approaches to email, at least one of them would be a clone of Blackberry email, as a holdover for the really great email products that would likely be coming. There&#8217;s no doubt a lot of interest among developers in the iPhone, but it probably wil never be greater than it was in the first weeks the phone was released. More likely, the iPhone, if it attains success, will reach it the way the Mac did, after the initial fatal flaws are removed, in the &#171;iPhone Plus&#187; or whatever.
> 
> Remember, in the 80s Apple was the first company to build networking into every machine, and later the first company to ship a wifi router. Hopefully it&#8217;s possible for Apple to open today&#8217;s iPhone, and reward the early adopters for betting on them, and get developers busy at fulfilling the opportunities it creates as a platform, not just a device.
