Оказывается, принять &#171;Дорожную карту&#187; <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/bin/en.jsp?enPage=ArticlePage&#038;enDisplay=view&#038;enDispWhat=object&#038;enDispWho=Article%5El2438&#038;enZone=Politics&#038;enVersion=0&#038;" target="_blank">не позволяет Тора</a>:

The emergency meeting of the group, which was established ten years ago in response to the Oslo Accords, said no Israeli government has the authority to give away a portion of Israel for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
