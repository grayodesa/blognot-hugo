<a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=16902006" target="_blank">Потрясающе</a> &#8212; в Штатах ведется разработка &#171;гиперпространственного&#187; космического двигателя.

> AN EXTRAORDINARY &#171;hyperspace&#187; engine that could make interstellar space travel a reality by flying into other dimensions is being investigated by the United States government.
> 
> The hypothetical device, which has been outlined in principle but is based on a controversial theory about the fabric of the universe, could potentially allow a spacecraft to travel to Mars in three hours and journey to a star 11 light years away in just 80 days, according to a report in today&#8217;s New Scientist magazine.
> 
> The theoretical engine works by creating an intense magnetic field that, according to ideas first developed by the late scientist Burkhard Heim in the 1950s, would produce a gravitational field and result in thrust for a spacecraft. 
> 
> The US air force has expressed an interest in the idea and scientists working for the American Department of Energy &#8212; which has a device known as the Z Machine that could generate the kind of magnetic fields required to drive the engine &#8212; say they may carry out a test if the theory withstands further scrutiny.
> 
> Professor Jochem Hauser, one of the scientists who put forward the idea, told The Scotsman that if everything went well **a working engine could be tested in about five years**.
