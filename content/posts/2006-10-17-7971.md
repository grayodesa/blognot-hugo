Technorati <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/17/HNmultilingualblog_1.html?source=rss&url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/17/HNmultilingualblog_1.html" target="_blank">заключила соглашение</a> с европейской пиар-фирмой Edelman для разработки локализированных версий своего сервиса для французского, немецкого, итальянского, китайского и корейского языков, после разработки которых Edelman получит исключительное право на их использование до начала следующего года.

В статье приводится любопытная статистика по европейским блогам:

> Most blogs today are published in English (39 percent) and Japanese (31 percent), according to Edelman/Technorati, but that make-up is changing, with more non-English blogs appearing every day. 
> 
> Businesses and brands are discussed in European blogs, but not nearly as often as in the U.S. and in Japan, the companies said. In a recent study by the companies of 213 Japanese bloggers, 84.5 percent said they blog about companies, and more than half said they were never contacted by companies. 
> 
> Among the other recent findings of Edelman and Technorati are the following: 
> 
> &#8212; Nearly a quarter of the population in the U.S., the U.K. and France read blogs at least once a week 
> 
> &#8212; The number of media articles mentioning blogs has steadily increased, reaching a high of 766 mentions in the second quarter this year 
> 
> &#8212; The English, Japanese and Chinese languages account for 82 percent of blog postings 
> 
> &#8212; All but one of the world&#8217;s 100 most influential blogs are published by Americans. The exception, by the&nbsp;[Italian commentator Beppe Grillo][1], at number 28, is in English as well as Italian 
> 
> &#8212; More French blogs tend to be personal journals (30 percent), followed by technology and business (22 percent) and cooking (19 percent) 
> 
> &#8212; Most German blogs are about technology (25 percent), followed by personal journals (22 percent) and media and/or public relations (12 percent) 
> 
> &#8212; Italian blogs are mostly personal diaries (43 percent), followed by political blogs (27 percent) and technology (11 percent) 
> 
> &#8212; U.S. blogs are mostly about technology (34 percent), followed by culture and entertainment (26 percent), politics (25 percent) and business (12 percent). Only 3 percent of U.S. blogs are personal diaries.
