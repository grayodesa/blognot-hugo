Интересно, <a href="http://www.torrentreactor.net/village.php" target="_blank">фейк или нет</a>?

> Torrentreactor.net is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the few companies that has decided to&nbsp;leave a&nbsp;permanent mark on&nbsp;the world map and rename a&nbsp;settlement after itself. The one with real houses and live inhabitants. A&nbsp;small russian village Gar was chosen to&nbsp;be&nbsp;renamed. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;located not far away from Seversk nuclear reactor (Russia, Tomsk region). As&nbsp;opposed to&nbsp;Google town that became the Texas &laquo;capital&raquo; for a&nbsp;limited period of&nbsp;time Torrentreactor village will retain its name forever. The price of&nbsp;$150,000 was announced for such &laquo;live billboard&raquo;.

> First reaction of&nbsp;Tomsk region authorities was controversial. But due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;considerable donation in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;village citizens that accompanies the deal it&nbsp;was resolved pretty fast. The donation seems to&nbsp;cover costs for future development of&nbsp;the settlement and increase life standards.

> Admins of&nbsp;the portal claim that adverisement and publicity is&nbsp;not the main goal of&nbsp;this whole act. They want to&nbsp;provide real help to&nbsp;at&nbsp;least one single village. &laquo;We&nbsp;realize it&rsquo;s just a&nbsp;drop in&nbsp;the ocean comparing to&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;money needed to&nbsp;help thousands of&nbsp;other villages. But we&nbsp;at&nbsp;least do&nbsp;something to&nbsp;support complete strangers. We&nbsp;are proud that we&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;and hope we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;this in&nbsp;the future. We&nbsp;would be&nbsp;even happier to&nbsp;become pioneers and other large Internet portals would follow our example to&nbsp;help many godforsaken places on&nbsp;Earth.&raquo;

> The selection is&nbsp;explained easily as&nbsp;well: &laquo;We&rsquo;ve picked a&nbsp;few thousands of&nbsp;godforsaken places around the world that are close to&nbsp;operating nuclear reactors to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;our company. The list was numbered and a&nbsp;random number was picked by&nbsp;a&nbsp;generator. The number 377 was a&nbsp;lucky one for Gar village. We&nbsp;think it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good choice since Gar citizens are very kind and generous people.&raquo;

Пиар, конечно, интересный, но&nbsp;какой-то бессмысленный. За&nbsp;150 тысяч долларов купить село&nbsp;&mdash; и&nbsp;что с&nbsp;ним делать-то? Налоги платить и&nbsp;на&nbsp;совещания в&nbsp;район ездить?
