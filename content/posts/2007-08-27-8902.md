Tell me gypsy can you see me  
In your crystal ball  
I&#8217;m asking you what can I do  
My back&#8217;s against the wall  
And I can&#8217;t hold on much longer  
So I&#8217;ve come to you my friend  
For now my life seems at an end

I came to see you once before  
One hundred years ago  
You took my hand and broke the spell  
That should have let me go  
But my years have gone so slowly  
So I&#8217;m here again my friend  
For now my life is at an end 

20 лет назад я впервые услышал Deep Purple.
