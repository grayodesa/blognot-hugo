Рассел Битти <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008668.html" target="_blank">о переводе часов</a>:

> I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate the time change. I cannot tell you how much I despise having to move the clock back an hour for no reason. The change is so drastic. Suddenly it&rsquo;s 5 p.m. and it&rsquo;s getting dark out. And it&rsquo;s 8 p.m. and what was just a few months ago the time when you&rsquo;d see beautiful sunsets, is now pitch black. They should just outlaw the practice once and for all.

> There&rsquo;s really no &#8220;Autumn&#8221; in my head, there&rsquo;s just Dark and Light, Winter and Summer. And today was when it changed from one to the other. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;ve moved to California so I&rsquo;m still wearing shorts and sandals well into October, it&rsquo;s the lack of light that sucks. And moving it an hour back sucks more. Actually, it was a little chilly today. Cold sucks too. Bleh. 

Весьма экспрессивно.
