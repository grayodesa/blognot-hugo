А жив, между прочим, курилка, и даже [вызывает интерес инвесторов][1]:

> There haven’t been any big developments with the company, but Piper Jaffray analyst Samuel Kemp sees a couple things fueling recent optimism around the company. For one, the company’s recently introduced Groupon+ option, which lets customers get cash-back deals without actually printing out coupons, seems to be taking off. The deals are simply linked to users’ credit cards.
> 
> Groupon+ launched at the beginning of the month and Kemp thinks more people have been playing around with the feature, especially since the company offered a popular deal on Starbucks beverages this week. “A lot of people are seeing tangible improvement in the product and that it’s taking a lot of the friction out,” Kemp tells Barron’s Next. Since Groupon+ simply gives users cash back on their purchases, people don’t have to bother with coupons or looking like cheapskates when they pay.
> 
> More broadly, Wall Street seems to like that Groupon has finished restructuring its business through cost cuts and can now get back to work. “Investors can get behind the idea that focus is good for a company,” Kemp says.

А еще на него положила глаз IAC — это компания, которой принадлежит, в частности, Vimeo, Ask, бывший About.com, The Daily Beast, ну и разные мелочи. Все же 32 миллиона живых пользователей в Северной Америке совсем на дороге не валяются.
