Мировые расходы на вооружение <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L17176438.htm" target="_blank">выросли на 6% за последний год</a>:

> STOCKHOLM, June 17 (Reuters) &#8212; World military spending rose by six percent last year, growing twice as fast as in 2001 to reach $794 billion, largely as a result of the U.S.-led war on terrorism, a respected think-tank said on Tuesday.
> 
> Washington accounted for three quarters of the increase, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in its Yearbook, a defence and security policy publication widely recognised for the reliability of its data.
> 
> Russia overtook the United States as the world largest arms exporter while China was the largest importer followed by India, locked in an arms race with impoverished nuclear rival Pakistan.
