Интересная <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6450_7-5073810.html" target="_blank">статья</a> с жуткими пророчествами в адрес компакт-дисков. Очень хорошо у автора получилось:

> So why, after years of consumer griping, are CD prices finally heading south? It&#8217;s simple: The labels have no other choice. Corporations don&#8217;t make changes such as this in the spirit of fairness, no matter how many people complain. They do it because it makes sense from a profit&#8212;and perhaps, in this case, survival&#8212;standpoint.  
> People have simply reached the point where _they no longer think a CD is worth $18._ Before the widespread adoption of CD burners, most of us had no idea how little it cost to produce a CD, but now we&#8217;re wiser, though the more expensive, nonphysical aspects of CD production remain a mystery to most. And these days, if consumers want music, they obviously have several online alternatives to record stores.
