Подкупает прямота авторов, честно заявляющих:

> _9. Are any Baathist government buildings left standing?_  
> Yes, and this is a source of much cynicism both in Iraq and among critics abroad. The Foreign Ministry was looted and burned, as were the Ministries of Agriculture, Education, Interior and Finance. The one exception &#8212; the only major government building to escape unscathed through both the U.S. military assault and the looting that followed &#8212; was the Oil Ministry. Surrounded by American tanks, even its windows are intact.

При этом общее настроение &#8212; работа идет, все продвигается, обновленный Ирак обязательно возродится. Газета &#171;Правда&#187;, 1980-й год.
