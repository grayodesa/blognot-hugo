44 года назад, 1 мая 1964-го года, была <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/04/dayintech_0501" target="_blank">запущена первая в мире программа на BASIC`е</a>:

> Mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz had been trying to make computing more accessible to their undergraduate students. One problem was that available computing languages like Fortran and Algol were so complex that you really had to be a professional to use them.
> 
> So the two professors started writing easy-to-use programming languages in 1956. First came Dartmouth Simplified Code, or Darsimco. Next was the Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment, or Dope, which was too simple to be of much use. But Kemeny and Kurtz used what they learned to craft the Beginner&#8217;s All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, or Basic, starting in 1963.
> 
> The college&#8217;s General Electric GE-225 mainframe started running a Basic compiler at 4 a.m. on May 1, 1964. The new language was simple enough to use, and powerful enough to make it desirable. Students weren&#8217;t the only ones who liked Basic, Kurtz wrote: &#171;It turned out that easy-to-learn-and-use was also a good idea for faculty members, staff members and everyone else.&#187;
