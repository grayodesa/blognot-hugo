Бывший работник Google <a href="http://xooglers.blogspot.com/2006/03/speaking-of-trouble.html" target="_blank">удивляется</a>, почему люди покупают акции Google:

> Just as there are many reasons one might want to buy a share of a car, there are many reasons one might want to buy a share of a company. The company might pay dividends, or it might offer the potential of paying dividends in the future. If you buy a big enough share you can have a real say in how the company is run. Even if you don&#8217;t have the wherewithall to buy a big enough share to let you run the company, your small share might be sought out by someone who does have the means to buy a controlling interest. Or being a shareholder might entitle you to certain special privileges. (We own some stock in a winery that gives a 30% discount to its shareholders. We&#8217;ve made back our original investments many times over on wine discounts alone. The stock also pays dividends.)
> 
> But with Google, none of those reasons apply. Google has explicitly stated that it will never pay dividends. They have explicitly said that they will offer no guidance to investors. Their stock structure is such that even if you bought every single publicly traded share of Google stock, Larry and Sergey would still control the company because their privately held stock has ten times as many votes as your publicly traded shares. So there is no hope that your shares will ever be of value to someone attempting a hostile takeover of Google. Such a thing is simply not possible, so no one will ever try.

Единственное объяснение &#8212; это надежда на рост курса. Но это превращает акции Google в какое-то подобие MMM&#8230;
