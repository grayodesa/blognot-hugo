Дэйв Винер &#8212; очень точно про судьбу контента в интернете:

    This weekend there was a furor about Facebook&#8217;s terms of service &#8212; people figured out that when they publish stuff on Facebook they lose control of it. Facebook put that in writing in their terms of service, but anyone who follows Technorati knows that our content is spread all over god&#8217;s creation. People copy and paste whole blog posts, you wish they&#8217;d just link to them, but everyone has given up the fight on this, it&#8217;s completely out of control, and has been for a long time. I think Facebook did the right thing by spelling out in black and white the reality of the Internet. Once you hit publish, it&#8217;s gone.
