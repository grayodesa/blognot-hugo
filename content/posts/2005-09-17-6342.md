nmlss <a href="http://nmlss.com/wp/?p=171" target="_blank">цитирует</a> FAQ международной программы обмена студентов:

> **Q**. What is the selection process for the program?  
> **A**. IREX administers a two-stage, merit-based selection process. Applications are reviewed for technical eligibility. Next, all eligible applications are sent to Washington, DC and read and evaluated by a US selection committee of qualified academic specialists. Based on these evaluation results, IREX will select semifinalists who will be interviewed in person in their home countries and must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Finalists and alternates will be chosen after TOEFL test scores and interview results are evaluated. No grants can be obtained **po blatu**.

Действительно, смешно.
