<blockquote>
<p>Mr Scoble has expressed frustration working at Microsoft and he has also been unhappy with his compensation. He has created a tremendous amount of positive publicity for Microsoft but there have been many within the organisation that have resented his very public position. The company has not been able to control his views or his travels to various conferences and blogger meetings.</p>
<p>It is only within the past year that MSFT has tried to use his position as one of the most popular bloggers to its advantage, in public speaking engagements and other events. Before that, Mr Scoble had no travel buget and often would have to share hotel rooms and use his personal vacation days when speaking at various blogger conferences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, I love Microsoft and Microsoft did not lose me ‚Äî at least as a supporter and friend. I am not throwing away my Tablet PC or my Xbox or my other Microsoft stuff. üôÇ</p>
<p>Second, my management team is awesome and I don‚Äôt have a beef with them at all. They have ALWAYS supported me. I have, in my pocket, a corporate American Express card and they never have questioned any of my expenses. The reason I shared rooms with other bloggers is because I always treated Microsoft as a startup. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs proper to waste shareholder resources if you don‚Äôt need to.</p>
<p>Third, I wasn‚Äôt, and am not, frustrated at Microsoft. I‚Äôve never had more opportunities available to me. In fact, I am due to spend a day with ImagineCup contestants and Bill Gates later this month.</p>
<p>Fourth, believe it or not, but no one at Microsoft has complained to me about my views for a very long time. In fact, the harsher I got the more support I got. Friday I visited with Jonathan Schwartz, CEO of Sun Microsystems. Management at Microsoft didn‚Äôt say a thing about that. Imagine if your employees went to your fiercest competitor and had a very public lunch, wouldn‚Äôt you be up in arms? Not at Microsoft. At Microsoft I am encouraged to change the world and make things better for our customers.</p>
<p>Fifth, I‚Äôve never been told not to travel to any conference by anyone at Microsoft and my travel expenses were always approved. I was encouraged to meet with developers wherever they lived. And, it is my job to go around to Microsoft offices worldwide and interview employees about the technologies they are building. At many conferences, where I was speaking about non-Microsoft stuff, I didn‚Äôt feel it was appropriate to charge our shareholders for those expenses. That was my decision, not my boss‚Äôs.</p>

<p>Eighth, I‚Äôm not the only blogger at Microsoft. There are about 3,000 of them here. They are not having the plug pulled on them. They changed the world. I just was the cheerleader.</p>
